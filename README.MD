My first published game was Hyperbowl on the Atari ST for Mastertronic, and it was
based on the Amiga arcade version. So for the Game Off 2018 I am writing a version
crossed with Space War which was the first arcade game (it even predates Pong).

I will be posting a blog with progress which you can follow (link to be provided
once the blog is live.)
